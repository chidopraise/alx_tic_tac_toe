## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chidopraise/alx_tic_tac_toe.git
   cd alx_tic_tac_toe
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   This project doesn't have any external dependencies besides Node.js, so there's no need to run `npm install`.

3. **Start the WebSocket Server:**

   Run the following command to start the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The server will start running on `ws://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

1. **Open the Game in Your Browser:**

   Open `index.html` in your browser. You can do this by dragging the file into the browser window or opening it via the browser's file menu.

2. **Multiplayer Setup:**

   - Open `index.html` in two separate browser windows or tabs.
   - The first player to connect will be assigned 'X' and the second player will be assigned 'O'.
   - The player with 'X' starts the game.

3. **Gameplay:**

   - Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their mark ('X' or 'O').
   - The game will automatically check for a win or a draw after each move.
   - The game will display a message indicating the winner or if the game ended in a draw.

4. **End of Game:**

   - After the game ends (either by win, loss, or draw), the WebSocket connection will close automatically.
   - To play again, you will need to refresh both browser windows.
